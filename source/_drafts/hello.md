Welcome to the launch of my new and 1st website! My name is Waris Radji and I'm so excited to share with you my knowledge! The amount of ideas, how-toâ€™s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out.

## Where can I find information about you?

For additional information about me and why I am writing this blog, I encourage you to go to the [about](https://warisradji.com/about) page. But to summarize, I will mainly write articles about my passions, Scala programming, Data Science and Street Lifting to cite some examples. 

## How can I get involved?

Feel free to take part in my journey by suggesting ideas for articles and even writing articles on my blog yourself, it will be a pleasure! Comments, donations, and sharing are also welcome!

## How can I be informed?

To keep you informed of my future posts I invite you to follow me on my social networks (on the left) and even better on my newsletter (on the right) where you'll be informed each week of my latest posts. Subscribers to my newsletter will be able to receive small gifts! Keep a close eye on your mailbox.
