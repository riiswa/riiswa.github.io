The subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/streetliftingathletes/: 

It's a small step for man, but a giant step for the Streetlifting community."

I am pleased to announce the opening of our new community on Reddit. A place where we can all develop our discipline and have real discussions.
Every major sport has an official subreddit, why not us?

I invite you to read the slides attentively to prepare yourself for this new adventure.
The success of this project will depend on your investment, I count on you to spread it as much as possible.
